# SimpleTpa Language Translations
----- worked on -----

## Welcome
You can download already translated configs or you can contribute to the them. Make sure that the config's version is equal to the current plugin's version!


## Translations
If contributed to an already translated config or you translated one, you will receive the role of Translator in my Discord Support Server.

1. How to start? First of all, decide whether you want to contribute to an already translated config or you will make a new translation of the config to another language.
!!! Please, DO NOT recreate already existing translated configs !!! This means if there is a Spanish translation already, do not create another Spanish translation. Instead, contribute to the translation.
